# Reproductions of Scalar Field Dark Matter and Dark Energy

This repository contains the implementation of the interacting scalar field DM and DE model studied in [Scalar field dark matter and dark energy: A hybrid model for the dark sector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13653.pdf), by Carsten van de Bruck, Gaspard Poulot and Elsa M. Teixeira. The folder `Figures/` contains printscreens of some Figures in the paper as well as my reproductions.
