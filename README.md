# Reproductions of Scalar Field Models

This repository contains the implementation of some scalar field dark energy models. 

- The interacting scalar field DM and DE model studied in [Scalar field dark matter and dark energy: A hybrid model for the dark sector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13653.pdf), by Carsten van de Bruck, Gaspard Poulot and Elsa M. Teixeira. The folder `Figures/` contains printscreens of some Figures in the paper as well as my reproductions. The notebook `Interacting_Scalar_Fields.ipynb` contains the source code of the model solution and figures. The Mathematica notebook `perturbation_equations.nb` contains the derivation of perturbation equations.

- Monodromic Quintessence and K-Essence studied in [Monodromic Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01544.pdf) by Fabian Schmidt is reproduced in the notebooks `Monodromic_Quintessence.ipynb` and `Monodromic_K-Essence.ipynb`.
